# Doctor Recommendation System

This project is a doctor recommendation system built using Flask for the backend and a recommendation model. The API serves recommendations for doctors based on user interactions, specialization, and location. The frontend can be built using Next.js to consume the API and display the recommendations.

## Project Structure

```
myproject/
├── app.py
├── data/
│   ├── doctors.csv
│   ├── interactions.csv
├── models/
│   └── recommendation_model.pkl
├── templates/
├── utils/
└── static/
```

## Data

- `doctors.csv`: Contains information about doctors, including their specialization, location, rating, and consultation fee.
- `interactions.csv`: Contains interaction data between users and doctors, including user IDs, doctor IDs, and ratings.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn
```

### Run the Flask App

1. Ensure your data files (`doctors.csv` and `interactions.csv`) and model file (`recommendation_model.pkl`) are in the correct directories.
2. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

## API Endpoints

### Get Doctor Recommendations

- **URL**: `/recommend`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `user_id` (int): The ID of the user for whom recommendations are to be fetched.

- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Maryann Yusuf",
        "specialization": "Oncologist",
        "location": "Lagos",
        "rating": 4.8,
        "consultation_fee": 15000
      },
      // Other recommendations
    ]
  }
  ```

### Example Request

```bash
GET /recommend?user_id=1
```

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or a Python script:

### Using Postman

1. Open Postman.
2. Set the request type to `GET`.
3. Enter the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5001/recommend?user_id=1`.
4. Click `Send`.

### Using a Python Script

```python
import requests

# Replace with your actual user ID
sample_user_id = 1

# URL of your recommendation endpoint
url = f"http://127.0.0.1:5001/recommend?user_id={sample_user_id}"

try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    recommendations = response.json()

    if "error" in recommendations:
        print(f"Error: {recommendations['error']}")
    else:
        print("Recommended Doctors:")
        for doctor in recommendations["recommendations"]:
            print(f"ID: {doctor['id']}, Name: {doctor['name']}, Specialty: {doctor['specialization']}, Location: {doctor['location']}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Next.js Frontend Integration

To integrate this API with a Next.js frontend, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Next.js project.
2. Install Axios to make HTTP requests from the frontend.
3. Create a function to call your Flask API.
4. Create a React component to display the recommendations.
5. Pass the user ID to the component and fetch recommendations.
